            <p>After spending over three years as a Digital Marketing professional in the UK & Hong Kong, I wondered what more I could discover in this digital world. I am now a full-stack developer with a focus on frontend development. I wish to create digital projects that will make an impact, with not only amazing functionalities but also incredible user experience & designs.</p>
